The project “Le Petit Nicolas” is a simple interface that displays small characters who interact with each others and with the audience.

The main character is the 7 years old boy. He has a lot of friends. They all have their specifities, a unique identity. Alceste is the fat one, Clotaire the bottom of the class, Agnan the first one of the class and he wears glasses. Good characters is a first element for a good story. I wanted to use them, but keeping in mind that I wanted the most simple interface possible, inspired by the uncluttered style of the cartoonist Sempe.

So I decided to represent a character as a simple shape. I first though about a square that can reminds a pixel, the simplest entity possible. But finally decided to use triangle.

All the charaters will be displayed the same way, as a black triangle except Nicolas, that will be a red triangle to remind his red pullover. The difference between them will be their way to interact with each other and with the audience.

Each character can be seen as a pixel, putting them together and you can draw something. Move them so they interact with each other and you can make them alive. No more needed to start to tell a story.
