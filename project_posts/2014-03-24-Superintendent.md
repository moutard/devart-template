According to the book Nicolas and his friends are really boisterous. They do silly things as soon as the superintendent Mr Dubon takes his eyes of them. I would like to use this idea so that characters can interact with the audience. Imagine them quiet and disciplined when you look at them but moving and unruly when you turn your back on them.

Of course sometimes they wonâ€™t be fast enough to fool you.
