# Le Petit Nicolas

## Raphael, Moutard, moutard

The project “Le Petit Nicolas” is a simple interface that displays small characters who interact with each others and with the audience in order to tell a story.

This project is inspired by the French children’s book “Le Petit Nicolas”, illustrated by the famous cartoonist Sempe. The main character is a seven years old boy called Nicolas, that tells you it’s own story, focused on it’s own percepective of the world far from an adult interpretation.

I have always been impressed by the drawing. Uncluttered, empty background, only black and white, except for a small detail the red pullover of Nicolas. But you can evoke many emotions with a few black lines.

That’s why I decided to try to do the same. Forget the billion colors, high resolution screens, 3D. Focus on the essential, uncluttered. And tell a story. Because I like to think that art can be as simple as telling a story.
